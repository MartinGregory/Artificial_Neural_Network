# CPP_GitRepo_Neural_Network
This is a C++ Project where I implement a neural network from the scratch--i.e. NOT by using the already provided/prebuild plug-in and play modules akin to optimization functions, optimizers etc... In this project I'm building the moduls from scratch using primitive C++ data types.
