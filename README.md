# CPP_GitRepo_Neural_Network
This is a C++ Project where I implement a neural network from scratch--i.e. NOT by using the already provided/prebuilt plug-in and play modules akin to optimization functions, optimizers etc... available in libraries like TensorFlow and Keras. In this project I'm building the modules from scratch using primitive C++ data types.
