# CPP_GitRepo_Neural_Network
This is a C++ Project where I implement a Neural Network from scratch--i.e. NOT by using the already provided/prebuilt plug-in and play modules akin to optimization functions, optimizers etc... available in libraries like TensorFlow and Keras. In this project I'm building the modules from scratch using primitive C++ data types.

My code is platform-agnostic (i.e. it can run on any machine) because I’m only using the Standard Template Library. There shouldn’t be any platform-related problems when setting up your environment or trying out the code.
